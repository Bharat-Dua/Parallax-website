# 3D Parallax Scrolling Website

This project demonstrates how to create a visually immersive 3D parallax scrolling effect using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **transform** properties. The goal of this project is to practice and understand parallax scrolling techniques and 3D transformations in web development.

## Features

- A 3D parallax effect with smooth scrolling.
- Background and foreground layers move at different speeds to create a sense of depth.
- Responsive typography and text positioning.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling, layout, and creating the 3D transform effects.
- **Transform 3D**: Used to achieve the parallax effect by manipulating the z-axis.

## How It Works

- The background and foreground images are moved along the z-axis using the `translateZ` and `scale` properties to create a 3D effect.
- The perspective of the container ensures that the different layers move at different speeds as the user scrolls, resulting in a parallax effect.
